Chi squared test   | the awareness of zebra mussels among boatriders | categorical (yes/no) | boatriding activity | categorical(Pleasure,Jet-ski,Angler,Other) | Lake Mead | Discrete | investigate the association between the boating activity type and the awareness of zebra mussels | Little or no association beteen boating activity type and the awareness of the zebra mussels | 0.05 |[Fisherâ€™s exact approach for post hoc analysis of a chi-squared test](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0188709#abstract0)  |


Correlation | several subcortical structures (volume) | continuous | total score of each aptitude measure i.e., Vocabulary, Foresight, Paper Folding, Inductive Reasoning, Math | Discrete numerical values | 1. Age 2. Sex | 1. Age (continuous -> 16-29) 2.Sex (Discrete) | subcortical brain structural correlates of several broad aptitudes including Math, Vocabulary, Foresight, Paper Folding, and Inductive Reasoning | hypothesize that subcortical structure volumes would be associated with better performance across all measures of aptitude. | p = 0.05 | [Subcortical Correlates of Individual Differences in Aptitude](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0089425) |
