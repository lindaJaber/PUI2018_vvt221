# Assignment 3

* Independently coded and worked on the assignment.


# Assignment 4

* Independently coded the assignment.
* In the spirit of reproducibility, matched the seed with Rachel to verify the values of various correlation coefficients, p-values etc
* Extra-credit assignments: Borrowed the latitude and longitude limits from Rachel.
* Gave coding pointers to Linda, Qinyu
