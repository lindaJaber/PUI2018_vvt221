# Review of CitiBike project by Devashish Khulbe (dk3596)

### The formulation of null and alternative hypothesis and the formula looks fine. 

Two months ridership is looked into for testing whether people actually follow their new year resolutions. The analysis can be extended upto March to know the further trend. 
Also, it would have been better if we could segregate the people who have bike-riding as a new year resolution and people with other resolutions. In that case we might have been assured that the lower ridership in the next month is due to people not following their new year resolutions and not because of any other reason. Some other dataset may be looked into for that as the CitiBike one doesn't have those features as observations.

## Test to use for hypothesis testing

Since there are two samples (months) for which the data we are comparing, the z-test should be appropriate for testing the hypothesis.
Z-test would tell us whether the observations for the month of February are statistically same or different than that of January.
